<h3 class="archive__subtitle"> About me </h3>

<!---<h3 class="archive__subtitle">{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].recent_posts | default: "About me" }}</h3>-->
<p class="aboutme"> I completed my PhD thesis at the <a href="http://en.sibsau.ru"> Siberian State Aerospace University (SibSAU)</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nhUuuNQAAAAJ&hl=th"> Prof. Eugene Semenkin</a> and received my PhD degree in 2016 from the <a href="http://www.sfu-kras.ru/en"> Siberian Federal University</a> and the  <a href="http://icm.krasn.ru/index.php?lang=eng"> Institute of Computational Modeling of Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences</a>. The topic of my dissertation is “Cooperative Evolutionary Method for Multi-Objective Optimization in Speech Analysis”. My scientific interests include Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Neural Network Modeling, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Multi-Objective Optimization (see <a href="/_pages/publications/"> Publications</a>). </p>
<p class="aboutme"> Currently, I am a researcher and senior lecturer teaching Mathematical Analysis at the SibSAU. I take part in Russian and international scientific projects (German-Russian, Finnish-Russian) as a member of a research group. Also I was funded as a leader of some projects. In addition to academia, I have experience in the software industry – I worked in the IT-company as a System Analyst (see <a href="/_pages/projects/"> Projects</a> and <a href="/documents/CV_Brester.pdf"> CV</a>). </p>
<p class="aboutme"> I like investigating different cultures and languages – both natural and programming. I tend to be global and have a strong wish to be a valuable member of an international startup (see <a href="/_pages/interests/"> Interests</a>). </p>
